# __UNITED LODGE OF THEOSOPHISTS APP__

This app is being developed for the NGO __United Lodge of Theosophists__. The NGO has world wide branches and members. The app's development is broken up into various phases (TBD) and should take about 6 months to complete.

Main features of the app:
1. __User subscriptions__: The user can subscribe to one or more ULT centre from anywhere in the world. Subscriptions are available for news, events, audio lectures, video lectures and literature.
2. __Reminders__: For subscribed events, reminders are available for upcoming events.
3. __Push notifications__: Users can receive push notifications for reminders if they choose to receive them.
4. __Audio lectures__: Users should be able to stream, download and bookmark parts of an audio lecture for listening again or picking up from where they left off. Once listened to, the user should have the option to either delete the audio from their device or retain it.
5. __Video lectures__: Users should be able to stream, download and bookmark parts of a video lecture for viewing again or picking up from where they left off. Once watched, the user should have the option to either watch the video from their device or retain it.
6. __Literature__: Users should be able to download literature for further reading. Once read, the user should have the option to either delete the literature from their device or retain it.

The app has two main aspects:

1. FrontEnd - Developed by Ankush Laxman
2. BackEnd - Developed by Vikash Khanna
